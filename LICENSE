# Legalzard API Documentation

The LegalZard API provides access to a wide range of legal information and resources. It allows developers to retrieve information about software licenses, legal documents, legal entities, check license compatibility, and more. The API aims to facilitate the integration of legal information into applications, websites, or other software systems.

For detailed information about the LegalZard API, please refer to the documentation available at [LegalZard API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/22392526/2s93mBvyQx)

## Main Functionalities/Endpoints

The Legalzard API offers the following key features:

- **Retrieve Licence Information**: The legalzard API allows users to have a look at all the details that are relevant to a given Software license.
- **Create a Licence**: This involves adding information about a license to the database.
- **Updating License Information**: Updating any data that may have been erroneously entered or updated by the body governing the license.
- **Deleting a License**: Removing licenses from the database.
- **Checking For Compatibility of Licenses**: Establish how two licenses are compatible with each other. This is a percentage estimate of how likely it is to recommend use of two softwares under the two licenses in one project.
- **Generating Different Kinds of Policies**: Ability to generate the different kinds of policies required by websites and applications such as Software License Policy, Privacy Policies, Terms and Conditions, Cookies Policy, Disclaimers, End User License Agreements, Return and Refund, Website Terms of use, Employment contracts, Memorandum of Understanding, Non-Disclosure Agreements, GDPR Privacy Policy, Statement of Work, Non Compete Agreement and Website Security Policy.

## Responses 

The results of the Legalzard API are grouped into two groups:

- **Compatibility Results**: This is basically a percentage estimate of how compatible Software licenses are. This is mainly to guide software developers before they can leverage the different softwares/packages that are licenses under different Software Licenses. A detailed explanation also follows on why the percentage is high or low. Generally, 50% works as the threshold meaning that a percentage higher than 50% is recommended while a percentage higher than 70% is highly recommended.

- **License Information**: This is a summary of all the important details that is relevant for a given Software License. The user is able to have all this information in a summarized way without the need of an attorney.

- **Compliant Agreements**: In this case, a url to a given policy custom to your application or website is given. This ranges from  Software License Policy, Privacy Policies, Terms and Conditions, Cookies Policy, Disclaimers, End User License Agreements, Return and Refund, Website Terms of use, Employment contracts, Memorandum of Understanding, Non-Disclosure Agreements, GDPR Privacy Policy, Statement of Work, Non Compete Agreement and Website Security Policy. The user(often a developer) can then make use of the policy as needed or they can convert them to a pdf format if printing is needed.
